            Our team consists of top SDET/Automaton Engineers who has combined for almost two decades of QA (Quality
            Assurance) Automation experiences at companies ranging from some of the most well known to startups at their
            infant stage. These companies include Morgan Stanley, MLB Advanced Media, HBO, Samsung and Salesforce. Our
            experiences range from being the first SDET/Automaton Engineer at a startup setting up the QA Strategy and
            building the Test Automation Framework to working in large QA Automation and Manual QA Teams at well established
            global companies.

        <p class="mt-4">
            Our goal is to work with you to build the right Test Automation Framework and QA Process for your company. Our
            experiences have taught us that there is no one out of the box solution that works for all companies. This is
            because companies have different budgets, are of different sizes, at different stages of their lifecycles, in
            different industries with different focuses and priorities using different technology stacks.
