          Due to budgetary reasons, Quality Assurance is often neglected until
          the company starts seeing either critical quality issues such as
          customer complaints and/or large number of bugs being filed.

      A lot of this could be prevented with a well defined QA Process/Procedure
      and well written Automation Tests. Even companies who allocate sufficient
      or large budgets for QA could run into challenges when they don't have
      and/or follow good QA Strategy. This includes not adopting automation and
      overworking Manual QA, poorly written automation tests, testing with the
      incorrect type of tests (see Testing Pyramid), lack of documentation, and
      using strategy not suited for the company.
