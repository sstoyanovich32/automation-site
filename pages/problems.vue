                    Due to budgetary reasons, Quality Assurance is often neglected until the company starts
                    seeing either critical quality issues such as customer complaints and/or large number of 
                    bugs being filed.

        <p>A lot of this could be prevented with a well defined QA Process/Procedure 
                    and well written Automation Tests. Even companies who allocate sufficient or large budgets 
                    for QA could run into challenges when they don't have and/or follow good QA Strategy. 
                    This includes not adopting automation and overworking Manual QA, poorly written automation 
                    tests, testing with the incorrect type of tests (see Testing Pyramid), lack of documentation, 
                    and using strategy not suited for the company.</p>
