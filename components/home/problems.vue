          Due to budgetary restrictions, Quality Assurance testing is often
          neglected by software companies until they start seeing either
          critical quality issues, such as customer complaints, and/or a large
          number of bugs being filed.With a well defined QA Process/Procedure
          and well written Automation Tests these bugs could be identified early
          on, avoiding any large scale issues.

          Even companies who allocate sufficient or large budgets for QA run
          into challenges when they don't have and/or follow good QA Strategy.
          This includes not adopting automation, overworking Manual QA, poorly
          written automation tests, testing with the incorrect type of tests,
          lack of documentation, and using strategy not suited for the company.
