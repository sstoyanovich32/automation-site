          Due to budgetary reasons, Quality Assurance is often neglected until
          the company starts seeing either critical quality issues such as
          customer complaints and/or large number of bugs being filed.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-xl leading-loose">
          A lot of this could be prevented with a well defined QA
          Process/Procedure and well written Automation Tests. Even companies
          who allocate sufficient or large budgets for QA could run into
          challenges when they don't have and/or follow good QA Strategy. This
          includes not adopting automation and overworking Manual QA, poorly
          written automation tests, testing with the incorrect type of tests
          (see Testing Pyramid), lack of documentation, and using strategy not
          suited for the company.
