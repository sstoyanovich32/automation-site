            and practices for you from process and procedure to identifying test
            cases, to building the Test Automation Framework, and setting up
            Continuous Integration (CI). Together we will decide the language
            for your Test Automation Framework, and the framework for your CI.
            We will work closely with you to create your short, mid and long
            term QA Strategy so you can prepare and budget your QA needs
            accordingly.

            environment. We can also build the framework to take custom
            parameters that are important to you, such as logging and wait
            times.

            we can work together to determine the amount of access needed for us
            to build these tests for you.
